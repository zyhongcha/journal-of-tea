#WIP
This tea journal will be running on Nginx, MongoDB, Next.js and CMS Strapi.

This project journaloftea.org is currently under construction,
as we aim to rebuild this website into a public community-driven tea blog publishing platform.
If you are interested in our project and would like to contribute, please contact me via <a href="mailto:zyhongcha@gmail.com">zyhongcha@gmail.com</a>.
This project is open-source and I welcome any tea enthuasist and developer in supporting us :)
